 I think about the days when I was young
 And all they said was I came on too strong
 and all these memories, circling in the breeze
 boy, it's been so long 

Falling rain, I looked into her eyes and I couldn't stop the the song
In the rocky road of life
Shared a spec of glamour
I can't help but be enamoured
with the wonder of it all

aah, blue mists running up the mountains
fomo and it's a go, I never know if it will last
pyromancers and nightly dancers in the sands of time
wyrms of highlands are inviting
paleantologists and the white horse having conversations about
who's the next queen

In the mud, dirt and blood, joyous and sublime
Oh, the darkness, holy fires, poison and blindness
There's never been a moment that I regret
Weaponized , hypnotized, died and reborn,
but haven't, not ever, failed to see the wonder of it all
