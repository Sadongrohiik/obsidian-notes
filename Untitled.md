 I think about the days when I was young
 And all they said was I came out too strong
 and all these memories, circling in the breeze
 boy, it's been so long ago

Falling rain and I looked into her eyes and I couldn't stop the the song
In the rocky road of life
Shared a spec of glamour
I can't find the pssing

aah, blue mists of the endless borsilan
fomo and it's a go, I don't know where it's gone
pyromancers and nightly dancers in the sands of time
wyrms of highlands are inviting
paleantologist and the white horse having conversations about
who's the next queen
