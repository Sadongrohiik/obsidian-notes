## Biofuel Production from Algae

### Bioethanol Production

#### 1. Pretreatment

- **Cell Disruption:** Break down the algae cells to release carbohydrates. This can be done through mechanical, chemical, or enzymatic methods.
- **Hydrolysis:** Convert the released carbohydrates into simple sugars using enzymes or acids.

#### 2. Fermentation

- **Fermentation:** Use yeast or bacteria to ferment the simple sugars into ethanol.
- **Distillation:** Separate the ethanol from the fermentation broth through distillation.

#### 3. Purification

- **Dehydration:** Remove any remaining water from the ethanol to produce pure bioethanol.

### Biodiesel Production

#### 1. Lipid Extraction

- **Cell Disruption:** Break down the algae cells to release lipids. This can be done through mechanical, chemical, or enzymatic methods.
- **Solvent Extraction:** Use organic solvents like hexane, ethanol, or a mixture of solvents to extract the lipids from the disrupted cells.

#### 2. Transesterification

- **Transesterification:** Convert the extracted lipids into biodiesel by reacting them with an alcohol (usually methanol) in the presence of a catalyst (usually sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide).
- **Separation:** Separate the biodiesel from the glycerol byproduct.

#### 3. Purification

- **Washing:** Wash the biodiesel to remove any remaining impurities.
- **Drying:** Dry the biodiesel to remove any remaining water.

### Buthanol

Butanol can be made from algae or diatoms using only a solar powered biorefinery. This fuel has an energy density 10% less than gasoline, and greater than that of either ethanol or methanol. In most gasoline engines, butanol can be used in place of gasoline with no modifications. In several tests, butanol consumption is similar to that of gasoline, and when blended with gasoline, provides better performance and corrosion resistance than that of ethanol or E85

The green waste left over from the algae oil extraction can be used to produce butanol. In addition, it has been shown that macroalgae (seaweeds) can be fermented by bacteria of genus Clostridia to butanol and other solvents. Transesterification of seaweed oil (into biodiesel) is also possible with species such as Chaetomorpha linum, Ulva lactuca, and Enteromorpha compressa (Ulva).
