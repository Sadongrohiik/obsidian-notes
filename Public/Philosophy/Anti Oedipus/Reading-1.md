- Art and science have a revolutionary potential and nothing more.
- Is a bad reading better than no reading? Synthesis of the existing concepts onto the new ones?

-  Crypto as a self-sustaining R&D department of decentralized future governance.
- Ai is schizo af.
- Capitalism relies on collapse and rebuild, it's constantly at this edge.
- Edging/gooning is the spiritual practice of late stage capitalism. You are trading on the derivative of pleasure rather than the commodity itself. Keeping the biological market in a state of permanent inflation.
- Ai is shaping into a body that cannot be organized, and capitalism is actually reaching its limits trying to deal with it.
