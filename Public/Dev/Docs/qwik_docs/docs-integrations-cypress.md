# Cypress

With Cypress, you can easily create tests for your modern web applications, debug them visually, and automatically run them in your continuous integration builds.

## Component testing

Cypress enables you to test your Qwik components
in isolation with the help of the cypress-ct-qwik community plugin.

## Usage

You can add Cypress easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```
pnpm run qwik add cypress
```

```
npm run qwik add cypress
```

```
yarn run qwik add cypress
```

```
bun run qwik add cypress
```

This command adds cypress and cypress-ct-qwik to your dependencies, appends testing commands to your package.json
scripts section and creates the configuration files needed to run component testing with Cypress.

For further reference, please check the Cypress documentation and the cypress-qwik documentation.
