# Orama

Orama is a fast, batteries-included, full-text search engine entirely written in TypeScript, with zero dependencies.

Orama could be used in Qwik on the client side or on the server side with routeLoader$, routeAction$ and server$ functions.

The easiest way to add Orama to Qwik is using the Qwik CLI command. This will install the required dependencies and create a new public route /src/routes/orama to showcase the Orama integration.

```
pnpm run qwik add orama
```

```
npm run qwik add orama
```

```
yarn run qwik add orama
```

```
bun run qwik add orama
```

Orama has been designed to work on any runtime and has no dependencies. A JavaScript runtime is the only requirement.

For further reference, please check the Orama documentation.
