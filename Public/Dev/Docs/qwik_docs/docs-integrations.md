# Integrations

Qwik CLI comes with integrations to make it easy to connect to your tooling and services.

Once you create a Qwik City application, run the following command to add new integrations:

```
pnpm run qwik add
```

```
npm run qwik add
```

```
yarn run qwik add
```

```
bun run qwik add
```

This command will prompt you to select the integration you want to add. Once selected, the integration will be added to your application and you can start using it.

For Monorepos: you can add integrations to a specific package by running the command with the --projectDir=some/subDir param.
