# Static Assets

Use the /public folder to store all static assets such as images, fonts, etc.

All static assets are served from your server's root (/ as in https://example.com/) folder and superimposed under your routes (routes have priority).

```
public/
├── favicon.ico           # https://example.com/favicon.ico
└── images/
    └── logo.png          # https://example.com/images/logo.png
```
