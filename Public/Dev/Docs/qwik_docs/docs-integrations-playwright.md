# Playwright

Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps supporting all modern rendering engines and works cross-platform. Playwright Website.

## Usage

You can add Playwright easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```
pnpm run qwik add playwright
```

```
npm run qwik add playwright
```

```
yarn run qwik add playwright
```

```
bun run qwik add playwright
```

The previous command adds playwright to your dependencies, appends a test.e2e command in your package.json scripts section and creates a default configuration within the playwright.config.ts file on the application root level.
It also adds a new file within a newly created tests folder called example.spec.ts which contains some simple test cases.

For further reference, please check the Playwright documentation.
