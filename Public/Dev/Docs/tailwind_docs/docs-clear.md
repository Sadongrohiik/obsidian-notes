## Examples

### Clearing left

Use theclear-leftutility to position an element below any preceding left-floated elements:

Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.

```
<article>  <img class="float-left ..." src="/img/snow-mountains.jpg" />  <img class="float-right ..." src="/img/green-mountains.jpg" />  <p class="clear-left ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p></article>
```

### Clearing right

Use theclear-rightutility to position an element below any preceding right-floated elements:

Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.

```
<article>  <img class="float-left ..." src="/img/green-mountains.jpg" />  <img class="float-right ..." src="/img/snow-mountains.jpg" />  <p class="clear-right ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p></article>
```

### Clearing all

Use theclear-bothutility to position an element below all preceding floated elements:

Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.

```
<article>  <img class="float-left ..." src="/img/snow-mountains.jpg" />  <img class="float-right ..." src="/img/green-mountains.jpg" />  <p class="clear-both ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p></article>
```

### Using logical properties

Use theclear-startandclear-endutilities, which uselogical propertiesto map to either the left or right side based on the text direction:

ربما يمكننا العيش بدون مكتبات، أشخاص مثلي ومثلك. ربما. بالتأكيد، نحن أكبر من أن نغير العالم، ولكن ماذا عن ذلك الطفل الذي يجلس ويفتح كتابًا الآن في أحد فروع المكتبة المحلية ويجد رسومات للتبول والبول على القطة في القبعة والإخوة الصينيون الخمسة؟ ألا يستحق الأفضل؟ ينظر. إذا كنت تعتقد أن الأمر يتعلق بالغرامات المتأخرة والكتب المفقودة، فمن الأفضل أن تفكر مرة أخرى. يتعلق الأمر بحق ذلك الطفل في قراءة كتاب دون أن يتشوه عقله! أو: ربما يثيرك هذا يا سينفيلد؛ ربما هذه هي الطريقة التي تحصل بها على ركلاتك. أنت ورفاقك الطيبين.

```
<article dir="rtl">  <img class="float-left ..." src="/img/green-mountains.jpg" />  <img class="float-right ..." src="/img/green-mountains.jpg" />  <p class="clear-end ...">...ربما يمكننا العيش بدون مكتبات،</p></article>
```

### Disabling clears

Use theclear-noneutility to reset any clears that are applied to an element:

Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.

```
<article>  <img class="float-left ..." src="/img/green-mountains.jpg" />  <img class="float-right ..." src="/img/snow-mountains.jpg" />  <p class="clear-none ...">Maybe we can live without libraries...</p></article>
```

### Responsive design

Prefixaclearutilitywith a breakpoint variant likemd:to only apply the utility atmediumscreen sizes and above:

```
<p class="clear-left md:clear-none ...">  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
```
