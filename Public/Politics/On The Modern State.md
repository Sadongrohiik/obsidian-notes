The modern state has transcended God by a wide margin. In pre-Roman-Christianity, the role of God was voluntarily accepted by a person, families, or communities in the matters of spirituality. The role of shamans and priests were largely the same. They served as spiritual guides for the people who needed it. 

However, in the modern state, God (and religion), are either the sate or merely part of it. The modern state encompasses all aspects of life in which spirituality is merely a piece of the puzzle. This is evidenced by the fact that a good (possibly majority) of the people in the world, cannot survive without the sate. 

Before the birth of the modern state, communities survived and even thrived without the need for a state. A state was simply a larger organization of communities and effectively a multi-community alliance that did not dictate or regulate every aspects of the lives of its people. 

Laws, customs, Gods, religions, and survival of the people were not dependent on the sate. The state was simply a mere tool to increase the power of communities and facilitate co-operation (Facilitating trade, laws of commerce, protection, expansion, funding science, art, and providing services to the members of the community) in exchange for taxes and levies.. 

This state-as-a-service model where a state was effectively a social contract between smaller communities no longer exists today. The modern state is a totalitarian, despotic regime born from the unholy matrimony of a corrupted form of philosophy/religion (ideology) and the original form of a state.
