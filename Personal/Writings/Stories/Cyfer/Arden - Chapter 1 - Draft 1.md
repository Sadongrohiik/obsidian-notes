Arden, woke up again by the flashing blue light of screens, a long beep, and a dog barking somewhere in the distance. It was slightly past midnight, and it was quiet except for the low hum of the cooling fans and the occassional sounds of passing vehicles.

He rubbed his eyes and squinted at the bright screens. It was the second time he had fallen asleep that night. He didn't care much as this job was barely worth the time besides having something to eat. He couldn't tell why he still cared about that. Semi-limping, he got up from the beat up sofa and walked towards the mini-kitchen. 

He picked up a rusty coffee grinder from a heap of unassorted junk and started to grind some beans. This was one of the very few activities he'd not lost interest in over time. The grinder was made by someone who's name was lost to time, on the appliance itself and in the world, but the damn thing was reliable. If his father was around he'd probable say something like, "They don't make them like that anymore." or some other corny comment.

He chuckled at the thought while loading up the coffee machine. The machine, while not as rusty as the grinder, had certainly seen better days. It rumbled and started pouring the hot liquid into the bottom of the kettle. The glass kettle was the cleanest thing in the dingy apartment as Arden liked watching the liquid flow. It filled half the kettle and then the light flashed yellow, indicating that the machine was in warmer mode. 

He took out the kettle, and picked out a mug, and limped back to his station-bed. This was an odd job in the truest sense. The kind of job you can pick from the limited options you have as an absolutely disposable member of society.

It was something most people didn't want to do, but not important enough to pay any real money. It involved staring at multiple terminal-screens, network monitoring data, and a few other little windows to make sure no weird traffic was coming or going. He'd automated most of the work, setting alerts for suspicious cases and a few other clever tricks. He felt his talents were wasted over this nonsense, but he didn't care enough to do something about it, and certainly no one else did either. Where people are cheaper than processing power, no one really cares about automation.

Now, he woke up to one of his alerts, but he wasn't in a hurry. Usually these were privacy weirdos masking their traffic beyound multiple layers of tunnels, proxies, and private networks, so he wasn't in a rush to really look into it. Besides, he could barely even see the screens before having at least his first cup. 

He lit up a cigarette and started sipping his first cup. Unsurprisingly, it was damn good coffee. He spent almost half of what he made after rent on coffee. Imported from earth, lightly roasted, and very expensive. But it gave him joy, and it kept him awake during the night shifts. 

As his eyes started to come back to baseline, he casually reviewed the traffic the had woke him up that night. It was a bit unusual. It wasn't any weird ip's, huge packets, or anything that seemed malicious. It seemed lik it was deliberately trying to trigger his alerts without making a scene. Now, this wasn't super crazy, and it wasn't his first time. The whole web was teaming with random AI agents ranging from being let loose by some rando experimenting, developers honing up their skills, or just some asshole trying to annoy people.

No, the strange part was that it seemed to trigger his alarm specifically in a way to not cause alarm by anyone else. It reversed his system almost perfectly and was not trying to trigger anything general. He sighed. This meant that whatever was doing this had access had gotten hands on his data, and could potentially bypass his system. He needed to reconfigure the whole system. He got to work with a grimace, but still, on the back of his mind, the fact that it did not bypass the system and deliberately triggered the alert was bothering him. Maybe it was some pen-tester hired by the company that he didn't know about. 

He made a note of tracking down the ip after he was done reconfiguring the system.
