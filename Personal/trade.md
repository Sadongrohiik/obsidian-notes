 - DO NOT MOVE WITHOUT SAR UNLESS YOU HAVE SERIOUS SHIT

Move without sour at the bottom is terrible
we have SAR now but rsi is not in a good place
don't do bottom entries again we've been doing this over and over
and it needs to stop
if you believe move continues ***wait for a bounceback*** then enter to mitigate risk

move sithout SAR on flat bottom again
better position after bounceback but still not ideal
bad bad bad
