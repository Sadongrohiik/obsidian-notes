### Prophecy of the shattered skies

_In the time of the final reckoning, the skies shall bear witness to the end, and the world shall tremble beneath the weight of its sins._

_The sun shall turn black as sackcloth, and the moon shall become as blood. The stars shall fall from the heavens like figs from a tree, shaken by a strong wind._

_The seas shall boil and turn red, spewing forth creatures of the deep, abominations that shall crawl upon the land, spreading decay and pestilence in their wake._

_The earth shall quake, and great chasms shall open, swallowing cities whole. Mountains shall crumble, and rivers shall turn to dust._

_A great beast shall rise from the east, bearing seven heads and ten horns, each crowned with a blasphemous diadem. It shall trample the nations underfoot, and none shall stand against it._

_But lo, from the north, a warrior shall come, riding a steed of pale fire. In their hand, they shall wield a sword of righteous fury, and upon their brow, a crown of light._

_The warrior shall challenge the beast, and the skies shall shake with the thunder of their battle. The earth shall be bathed in blood and fire, and the very fabric of reality shall tear asunder._

_In the end, there shall be silence, and the world shall be reborn, and the faithful with it.
