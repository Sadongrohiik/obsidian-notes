I got borrowed wings
from depths of plasma
I have infinite eyes
A photonic pantomime 

Through all this 
The plane that never dies
Under the radiation of the black sun
I dance with electrons

And what it brings
tomorrow never comes
All things live and die
in Planck time

[C]
Invictus Infinitum 
It's what you seek
Invictus Infinitum
Secrets unseen
[c]

Sharing vibrations
that's all there is
Highs and lows
equilibrium by force

Find it and you'll see
potential infinitum
Your eyes are nothing
deceivers made by Gods

A sight echoes
through time and space
The threads are undone
this is not a race

[c]
Invictus Infinitum 
Forget all you know
Invictus Infinitum
at the center of it all
