The threads of fate were sown
Just for a moment I grasped
A path of dreams
A bridge I can't pass

Lay there, choices
The forks and the flows
Disconnected machines
Unbound, unborn

And all this
expressions of disbelief
some call faith
In solar storms
At the horizon

What weighs upon you
is what you create
The fields are neutral
The waves you bear

Here lies the unknowable
Discover, or don't
It haunts you the same
Gentle and bold

Infinities of refractions
Observations, distractions
Flows and interactions
consumed in subtractions

The beast lies here
So does the beauty
And all they give
Is bound duty
