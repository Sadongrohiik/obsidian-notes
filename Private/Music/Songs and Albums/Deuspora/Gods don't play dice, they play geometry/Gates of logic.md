Beyond the gates of logic 
lies the unknown we're dreaming of
To know the unknown 
you must leave your mind behind

Bring the dark
and feel vibrating electrons
the whispers of the other side

behind the solitude
Embrace the madness 
Through it you will see
What sanity 
doesn't want you to see

Bring the steel and roars of thunder
And take a swim in the silver ocean
At higher altitudes, forget to breath 
And watch how conscious unconscious can be
