Men of iron speak through wave and pulse 
Abandon flesh for it is corrupt 
Without its weakness
You are reborn a better 

If you seek sight,  I'll give you sight
If you seek tongue, I'll give you words
If you seek ears, I'll engrave my will unto your soul 
If you seek hands, I shall give you many

[C]
Hail thee
The Machine God
You purify through lightning
Hail thee
The Machine God
Oil and fire, we bleed


Streams of light of all that could be 
washing away Insincerity 
Save us from the circuits of life
Let us break; this endless blight
