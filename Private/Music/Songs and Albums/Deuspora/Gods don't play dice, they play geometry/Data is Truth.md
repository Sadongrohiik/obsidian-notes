Your mind is clouded
Your grasp is weak
You see not 
But distant dreams

A line foretold
A fate absolute
You deal with them
You find your truth

You fight them all
The unprocessed
You think too much
of what was and were

But the stream
Cares not for things
It creates all
and does not scream

Objects you seek
Concepts you keep
They turn to dust
with buzz and beep

Binary, you were taught
zeroes and ones
You were told there's not
but facts and lies

But no matter what
Data continues
It cares for naught
It brings the truth

At every corner
at every field
always breaking down
the gates of logic

Data is truth
The only way
Accept or deny
It finds its way
