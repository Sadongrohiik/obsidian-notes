### Icarus

  

Under the boundless canvas of skies

And on the earth that protects us

We seek truth in heavens

  

We built wings to lose our chains

But to the flames we were drawn

We fall into the ocean wide

But we rise, again

  

[c]

I hear the silent voices

Of the Elders forgotten

The wings are all worthless

Lose them and you’ll fly

Their call I shall forego

They don’t know what we know now

[c]

  

We built wings faster and stronger

We flew higher and higher

Never away from the flames

  

We endured the merciless blaze

And each time we fell for longer

As we saw our ancient foe

Now, as the object of desire

  

We saw the next fall, we won’t survive

We cut our wings as we signed our lives

Yet still, we longed for the sun god

  

[W]

  

Some broke their oath and took to the skies

For one who drowned, ten more tried

Their wings immaculate as the sun himself

Their epilogue the same every single time

  

Wings so glorious, we forgot the fall

The better wings you have, the better man you are

Most stayed on the ground, to protect their wings

Cheering those who dared to rise to the heat

And cheering their fall all the same

  

[c]

  
  
### The endless ocean 

  

I wept for my goddess

for Seven years of wandering

many a long days and starless nights

Stumbled in confusion and sorrow 

Stray, forsaken and lost

When all was lost 

exhausted and broken

I fell into the ocean wide

with depth as endless

as the depth of sorrow

  

floundered as I sank

Turquoise turned to black

Got the glimpse of the light

Then I turned my back

  

The endless darkness swallows me

  
  
  
  
  

Words cannot capture your beauty

Blackened cannot see your radiance

As gentle as the blue mist

As wild and strong as the roots of an eternal tree

Afraid of your power

Bind you

Blind themselves pretending you aren’t there

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

### Tyranny of the Sun  

In death I walk

Under the eternal sun

With vultures on my back

The refuge of shades, naught but a distant dream

The whispers of your spirit I hear

O giver of life

Your darkness stokes my fire

Your radiance, guides my path

  

Broken, with gleaming eyes I walk the path

The cross I bear weighs me to the ground

With searing skin, blinded by the light

I scale the mountains with bloody hands

I walk the path with bloody feet

  

I search for thee

The embrace of your eternal darkness

The wisdom of your gentle radiance 

To grasp the roots of the timeless tree
### Blood Moon

With power unmatched by the fires of Amon Amarth

And fierce as Vulcan’s steel

We shed blood in silence

As she watches from her throne

Crimson covers the fields

  
  
  

Give me fire, give me lust

Blood I shall spill till they are dust
### Dance of the crescent blades

  

And I heard as it were the symphony of cold steel

The night whispering behold

And I saw the dance of the crescent blades

In stolen fire

Graceful in chaos

Mocking the wrath of sun

  

  

Chosen of the Eclipse


### Hávamál

Will I see
if I close my eyes ?
Will I be free
if I bind my hands ?

### Ave Domina Nox

I gaze through the eyes
of the endless Abyss
I see the colors
Bleed through eternity

Ave, Domina Nox(2x)

Ah, Open your eyes
open your mouth
deceivers are coming


Salvation in darkness
Believe
