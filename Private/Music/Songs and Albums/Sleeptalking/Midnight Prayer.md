Hey, the life of me again
it's unto me again
The moment of despair

Hey, the sun is shining down
the day is unbegun
they give not but the pain

The eyes of the mountain
They call me forth
It sees
What they all pretend

Oh, Mother, take me to your arms
Give back the life they all stole
Bring again
the silence of the night

Oh, Father, show me all I can't see
Tell me all the secrets of the beast
one more time

Light a fire
under the moonlit sky
Bring them back
To sing for all the world

Bring your children
to the shore
and guide their way
