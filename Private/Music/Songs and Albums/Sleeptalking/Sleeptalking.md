You thought I meant you harm
and when I didn't do
You took my hands
and cut yourself

Every time the dawn seems so close
It's far away again
I can see their shadows
When you want to get away

Why does it feel so lonely
In the closet you hide in?
Can you wake up this morning
to watch the sun rise again?
