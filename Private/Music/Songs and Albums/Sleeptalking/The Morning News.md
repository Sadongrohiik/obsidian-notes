Every day, every morning
Have I been sleepwalking?
Can I find you again?
I see faces on the walls
The sent you left behind
Maybe I'll follow this time
Maybe I drink again

Have I been sleepwalking?
Didn't hear what they said
Can you see my face in the dark?
Where did I come from?
Can you wake up to watch the stars?
Can a river
Bring down a molehill
Is it worth a try?
