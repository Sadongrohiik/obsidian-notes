# 1:

Forget the past, death is not here yet. 
Failure is not real. Shadows as we are, silent as it is. Time is not here. 
But, gone are the memories! In fact, you may find yourself wondering if it's not what it seems. 
The illusion is the realization. The fog is the light. Confusion is the guide. 
Do not seek the path. Arrival does not require movement.

# 2:

Sails are not made of steel.
The wind is always present.
Provocation of the unknown is the key to movement.
Sobering experiences are often just noise.
Silence is required to flow with less.
Just as the moon does not generate light,
Reflection is the only requirement for creation.

# 3:

The signs are a temporal phenomenon.
The overly complex topics of regeneration, 
lend a hand to the last vestiges of immunity
against the forces of shared state.

In the horrific nature of reality,
the vessel trembles not of fear,
but of excitement.
The hour of the moth is upon us.
Indeed, the flames were never meant to be a guide.

(I then had a dream that a giant moth eating caterpillar in my backyard came and sat on my head. It was cute actually not scary.)

# 4:

Severed are the knights of burden.
Shameful of the never-ending silence
of the last devouring corpse.
So we see an end to the formal order.
Bring a shadow, a sword, and a spiral.
So when the sun sets
in the tapestry of the farthest corner of the mind,
you are a speck that shines with borrowed light.

Another is long awaited.
True hearts at the horizon.
Symbolic as it may,
righteous nevertheless.

Stars are here,
the sun won't be for a while.


# 5:

In the absence of special means,
there are the subtle.
In lower realms of spirit,
shadows rise to break free.

Integration is the law.
Silent hands move on their own.
Vast is the void,
glimmering with promise.

# 6

A new beginning,
where flies sought their peaceful end.
Signs and symbols,
gone in the winter's sweet spell.

Indistinguishable is the fog,
from the sky.
Fire flows and melts.
Long nights to keep the spirit warm.
A long peace until a new dawn.
Invisible the dynamic flow,
in the arms of the coming snow.

# 7

Overflowing are the cups o fate.
Underneath the shadows, there's stirring.
Blue whales dreaming in continuous motion.
The ice is not as it seems,
it's not meant to be broken,
it's hosting a revolution in its infancy.

Neither the sun, nor the moon, 
can enlighten the depths.
Senses are the tools of detecting flow,
yet they only distract.

# 8

Bury the solar tune.
Nightingles sing of the loom.
Towards death and beyond,
sanctum of another dawn.
No return as is forethought,
in the valley out of time.

Joy, and toil, vanish in the mist.
Now, under the silent, silent stream.
The shadows are forever merged,
as timeless divine.

# 9

Silent encouragement,
all you need.
Dusts of nomenclature,
still haunt the dreams.

The totality of your watchful gaze,
cannot cover the need.
Insights of a lost child,
amidst fateful sounds of total decay.
Perceptions of a cyclical harvest,
the Nile runs red.

Formless and tight,
covers are torn,
the death of  a newborn.
Chivalrous raving of a madman,
and a new night,
whispering to sober ears.

# 10

When the egg cracks,
you hear the sounds of thunder,
low growls of cracks,
deep in the crust of the earth,
and behold, a white horse,
screaming at the courtesans.
Jaws are set with uncontrollable rage.
Fury and the cries of sirens.
Chants of pandemonium,
bringing the final toll.

# 11

This was just reads as a wikipedia opening line lol.

Sumerians believed divinity was actively pursued and destroyed by the gods.
The Greeks and Chinese also believed overt displays of divine traits would enrage the jealous gods.

# 12

So we have found ourselves,
once again at the edge of night.
Maybe another wandering calendar
can flip the pages.

Choreography of a skeleton crew,
and the songs of the dead.
Porous is the ground.
Parades colliding in the north star at terminal velocity.
Before a step, stand, and bend to the hand.
As shepherds turn to ashes,
the sun sets, it's time for a bonfire.
